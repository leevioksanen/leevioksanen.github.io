                <br>
                <p> 
                    Boom Plague is a competitive co-op game inspired by the classic Bomberman, developed as a school project by a team of 5 students. 
                    The game features 1v1 matches where players strategically place bombs to outsmart their opponents.  
                    Designed in a vibrant pixel art style, the game is visually striking and enhanced by dynamic lighting and glow effects, creating a polished aesthetic. 
                    The game was built by using Unity and Photoshop.
                    My contribution for the game was to work with the explosion and glow effects.

                <h4>Magigun - Blender® & Unity®</h4>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    Magigun is a thrilling first-person shooter game developed as a school project by a team of 6 students.
                    Set in a dark, atmospheric sewer-dungeon environment, the game challenges players to survive against relentless waves of monsters.
                    As the difficulty increases with each wave, players can upgrade their weapons to stay in the fight longer.
                    The combination of strategic upgrades, fast-paced combat, and an immersive setting creates an engaging survival experience. 
                    The game was built by using Blender and Unity. My contribution for the game was to create the sewer/dungeon-like environment.

                <h4>Culinary Carnage - Asesprite® & Unity®</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Culinary Carnage is an exciting and dynamic game developed as a school project by a team of 5 students. 
                    Players face off against cunning vegetable enemies and formidable bosses as they fight to escape each challenging region. 
                    With a vast array of items to discover, players can experiment with countless combinations to customize their characters, 
                    balancing risk and reward as they decide whether to grab powerful loot or prioritize health for survival. 
                    Featuring three distinct regions, the game combines strategy, action, and exploration. The game was made with Unity and Asesprite. 
                    My contribution for the game was designing the environment tilemaps, as well as creating inventive traps and small items.

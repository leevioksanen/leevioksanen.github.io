                <p> 
                    This is a landing page designed for a music streaming platform. In this project, I focused entirely on a logical workflow.
                    I learned to structure the page content efficiently using a grid layout in Figma.
                    Before creating the actual page, I set up local styles for colors and fonts, which I used throughout the project. 
                    These can also be seen on the right side of the image.

                    I utilized Figma's Auto Layout feature to create a well-organized and structured design. 
                    All images used are free-to-use from Pexels. The artist names, text, and logo in the project are fictional and created by me.

                <br>
                <p> 
                    Here is an idea I developed for a mobile application to help users to follow a healthy diet and lifestyle. The application is called HealthyRecipes.
                    In the project, I used an earthy and wellness-inspired color theme. The project highlights mastering basic skills in the Figma program. 
                    During the project, I learned to create components and different variations of scrolling.
                    The idea of the application is to provide users with healthy yet nutritious meals and recipes. 
                    The app would allow users to create their own meal schedules and connect with professionals related to well-being. 
                    The amount of content is limited, as the project's focus was on exploring Figma's functionalities and the UI/UX design of the application. 
                    The video below demonstrates how the application would function in practice. 
                    All layouts and UI designs were developed by me, adhering to the universal design patterns of mobile applications.

                    This project is called PickYourShoe.
                    The goal was to create a seamless experience by connecting multiple pages while simulating a functional shoe selection interface. 
                    This project helped me practice navigation flows, transitions, and interactive elements within Figma. 
                    All images used are from free-to-use source with-in Figma.

                <p> 
                    I created various components in Figma, focusing on learning how to prototype them effectively and explore different variations in prototyping. 
                    My main goal was to ensure smooth functionality using auto layouts and framing while minimizing repetitive steps.
